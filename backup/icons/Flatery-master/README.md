## Installation:
After downloading/extracting, move the `Flatery` and `Flatery-Dark` folders to `/usr/share/icons` if you want them to be visible for all users.
If you want them to be visible only to your user, move them to `~/.icons` (GTK-based distros) or `~/.local/share/icons` (KDE-based distros).

Similarily move the `Flatery-wallpapers` folder to `/usr/share/wallpapers` or `~/.local/share/wallpapers`.
