{"author": "brownsr", "name": "SimpleDock", "description": "Simple centre zone dark dock to left, right and bottom, with adjacent right and left zones transparent.  Derived from Graphite Zero (see credits there), with reduced rounding and menu border.  Suggest setting the 'dock' panel to autohide or intelligent hide if you want the 'dock' not to constrain the space for windows.  Please note that this does not bring all the functionality that a full blown dock would, it is still a standard panel", "license": "GPL3"}
