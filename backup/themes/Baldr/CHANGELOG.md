\- Apr 29, 2013: Brought up-to-date with Cinnamon 1.7.7 + menu right click submenu bug fix (thx GREY_FOX!)

\- Jan 12, 2013: Small menu improvement

\- Jan 4, 2013: Some users experienced lag with Baldr so I have toned down the box-shadow (my main suspect) - the calendar is a bit dull now but hopefully quicker for those who experience lag :o)

\- Dec 26, 2012: Massive overhaul - basically a new theme
