Spearmint Leaf was a combined effort between myself and Luisrafaelgalvez. So be sure to thank him for this theme as well, as he did do most of the work on this project.

The goal of this theme was to combine my Spearmint theme with his MintLeaf theme and this is the result.

You can find his themes here: [\[link\]](https://luisrafaelgalvez.deviantart.com/)

Hope you enjoy this theme!
